After downloading VSCode from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/),follow the installation instructions and you should see a startup window similar to the screenshots above. Make sure to download VSCode for the correct operating system.

## Remotely Connecting 
Step 1. Open up a terminal window in VSCode by using the top menu (Terminal â†’ New Terminal).  
Step 2. Type in the code `ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, replacing `zz` with your couse specific account and type in `yes` to the following prompt: 
```
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec
```

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?`  
Step 3. Type in your password that you set from the [UCSD password-change website](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). (Note that when you type in your password, symbols such as *** won't show up so hit enter again to reset if you made a mistake while typing your password)
